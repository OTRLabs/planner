# Offensive Security Operations Management System | Planning Your Operations More Effectively

## Introduction

I would like to design a `Web app` based `application`

My goal is to create an alternative to tools like [Maltego](https://maltego.com) & [OpenCTI](https://filigran.io/solutions/products/opencti-threat-intelligence), or [OpenBAS](https://filigran.io/solutions/open-bas/)  

### 1. Planning
My primary goal in creating this application is to focus on planning out `offensive security operations`, based on a variety of industry standard methodolgies such as [Mitre Att&ck](https://attack.mitre.com)
This will use a html canvas with moveable nodes and lines to represent the various stages of an operation.
### 2. Intelligence Gathering
In addition to the planningh feature which focuses on providing information to the operators to make effective informed decisions when conducting offensive security operations, I also intend to have a set of features focused on intelligence gathering 

The goal is to have a web based application that has a series of views the user can choose to engage with

- home view
- Feed view - similar to Facebook or twitter. Image & or text based messages displaying relevant information
- Campaigns list
    - Graph view of a campaign
    - Table view
    - Kanban view
- analytics view
- Topics view
- RAG based LLM chat view

I intend for there to be a centralized duckdb  database as the ultimate repository of data for all events, knowledge, etc. 

My intentions are to develop the app with the following tech stack

**frontend tools & tech**

- [React](https://react.dev) 
- [ShadCN UI](https://ui.shadcn.com/)
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
    `Shadcn UI + Vite` Can be installed using [this guide](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs/installation/vite)

**Backend Tools & tech**

- Written in Python 3.12
    - Using [PDM](https://github.com/pdm-project/pdm) as the package manager. `PDM` is a modern Python package and dependency manager supporting the latest PEP standards 
- [Litestar](https://litestar.dev)

- [Advanced alchemy](https://github.com/litestar-org/advanced-alchemy) plugin for [sqlalchemy](https://github.com/sqlalchemy/sqlalchemy) 

- [Vite plugin for litestar](https://github.com/cofin/litestar-vite)

- [Feeds Python Library](https://github.com/kurtmckee/feedparser)

- [Ollama](https://ollama.com)
- [Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/)

**Database tools & Tech**

- [DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/)
- `Advanced alchemy` plugin for `sqlalchemy`, uses `duckdb` as the backend database

**Deployment Tools & Tech**

- [Docker](https://docker.com)
- [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)

# Features & Functionality
Outlining the features and functionality of the application.


## Data Ingestion & Aggergation
The backbone of this application is the data ingestion and aggregation system. This system will be responsible for collecting data from a variety of sources and aggregating it into a single database.

### Data Sources

#### News Feeds
- [Bleeping Computer](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/)
- [Kerbos on Security](https://krebsonsecurity.com/)
- [The Hacker News](https://thehackernews.com/)
- [Darknet Diaries](https://darknetdiaries.com/)

#### Vulnerability Feeds
- [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/)
- [Vulners](https://vulners.com/)
- [Exploit Database](https://www.exploit-db.com/)

#### Event Feeds
##### RSS Event Feeds
- [Ransomware.live](https://ransomware.live/)
- [VxUnderground](https://vxug.fakedoma.in/)
- [CISA](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ncas/alerts) 
##### Twitter Event Feeds
- [Bleeping Computer](https://twitter.com/BleepinComputer)
- [The Hacker News](https://twitter.com/TheHackersNews)
- [Krebs on Security](https://twitter.com/briankrebs)
- [VxUnderground](https://twitter.com/vxunderground)
- [MalwareTech](https://twitter.com/MalwareTechBlog)
- [MalwareHunterTeam](https://twitter.com/malwrhunterteam)

- [Darkwebnews](https://twitter.com/DarkWebNews)


#### Upload Tools
- Nmap Scans
- Nuclei Scans
- etc



## Planning

### Intended Use & Audience

Generally speaking this application is geared towards someone who is not only interested in Cyber security and threat intelligence but also works in offensive security. I think something like OpenCTI would be more useful for someone only interested in data aggregation but we want to make heavy use of the planning features as well

The planning is intended to be done using a combination of human and machine intelligence trained on the data gathered for the news feed. The ultimate goal is to create plans for how to approach, and continuously manage attack situations & scenarios when conducting offensive security operations

Scenarios we are looking to plan for are 

- bug bounties
- Penetration Testing
- Red team engagement
- APT emulation
- Purple team collaboration
- Tailored Access Operations
- Blue teaming for continuous infrastructure management and maintenance

but ideally we will have a system that is highly flexible and can work efficiently with all kinds of projects and activities 

The primary philosophy behind this system is a sort of measure 5 times cut once 

You want to have a comprehensive understanding of your target before you make any serious moves




## Long Term Goals

### Ecosystem, Integrations & Plugins 

I would like to have a system that is highly extensible and can be integrated with a variety of other tools and systems.

Something similar to [OpenCTI's Ecosystem](https://filigran.notion.site/OpenCTI-Ecosystem-868329e9fb734fca89692b2ed6087e76) is highly desirable!

This prevents any blunders from occurring and allows you to avoid accidentally exposing your operations, or a variety of other situations
